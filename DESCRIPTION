Title: Stratification and Matching for Large Observational Data Sets
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Rachael C. Aikens, Michael Baiocchi
Maintainer: Rachael C. Aikens <raikens@stanford.edu>
Description: While matching is a mainstay in causal inference for observational
    studies, the speed of many matching algorithms scale poorly with the number 
    of observations.  As the sizes of observational studies grow larger with 
    the advance of "big data," the computational task of matching becomes more 
    cumbersome.  Big_match will break down the matching task by strata of 
    manageable size, and parallelize the matching task across strata.
